# PKW Telegram Calculator for PROFIBUS/PROFINET Communication

## Introduction

In industrial automation, efficient communication between **PLCs** and **drives** is crucial for precise control and monitoring of processes. When using **PROFIBUS** or **PROFINET** networks, exchanging parameter data between a **Siemens PLC** and a **drive** (such as **SINAMICS G120** or **MICROMASTER 4**) requires accurate construction of **PKW (Parameter Control Words)** telegrams.

However, **manual calculation of PKW telegrams** can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when handling complex parameter structures, different data types (Word, Double Word, IEEE 754), and array indices. Misconfigurations in PKW telegrams can lead to **communication failures**, **inaccurate parameter settings**, and **inefficient debugging**.

To address these challenges, I developed the **PKW Telegram Calculator**—a Python-based tool with an intuitive GUI that **automates the PKW calculation process**, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. This tool is particularly beneficial for engineers, technicians, and researchers working with **PROFIBUS/PROFINET networks** in industrial automation environments.

## Why This Tool Matters

1. **Eliminates Manual Errors:**  
   The complexity of PKW telegram construction, including bit-level manipulations and parameter mapping, often leads to human errors. This tool ensures that the **correct bit patterns** are generated based on **PROFIDrive standards**.

2. **Saves Engineering Time:**  
   Automating the calculation process significantly **reduces configuration time**, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level tasks like system optimization and diagnostics.

3. **Educational Value:**  
   The tool serves as a **learning aid** for students and professionals, helping them understand how **PKW structures** are formed and how parameters are transmitted between PLCs and drives.

4. **Error Interpretation:**  
   It doesn’t just calculate telegrams—it also **decodes response telegrams** from drives, interpreting error codes based on **PROFIDrive specifications**. This feature streamlines troubleshooting by providing **clear diagnostic messages**.

## Features

- **PKW Calculation for Read/Write Operations:**  
  Automates the generation of PKW telegrams for both reading and writing parameters.

- **Automatic Data Type Conversion:**  
  Supports **16-bit (Word)**, **32-bit (Double Word)**, and **IEEE 754 Floating Point** conversions, automatically selecting the appropriate format based on the parameter type.

- **Array Indexing Support:**  
  Handles complex parameters with array sub-indexes seamlessly.

- **Error Code Interpretation:**  
  Decodes drive responses and provides **human-readable diagnostics** for troubleshooting communication errors.

- **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  Developed using **Tkinter**, the tool provides a clean, intuitive interface for parameter input and result visualization.

## How PKW Works in PROFIBUS/PROFINET

In a **PROFIBUS** or **PROFINET** network, the communication between a **PLC** and a **drive** is governed by the **PROFIDrive profile**, which defines how parameters are structured and exchanged.

- The **PKW (Parameter Control Word)** is the section of the telegram responsible for reading or writing parameter data.
- Each PKW telegram consists of:
  - **PKE (Parameter Identifier):** Defines the parameter number and the request type (read/write).
  - **IND (Parameter Index):** Specifies array indices or parameter page selections.
  - **PWE1 and PWE2 (Parameter Values):** Hold the actual data for the parameter, depending on its type (Word/Double Word).

Correctly configuring these telegrams is essential for **precise drive control**, and this tool simplifies that process by automatically generating the correct structure based on user inputs.

## How to Use

### 1. Generate PKW Telegrams

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python pkw_calculator.py
   ```
2. In the **"Generate Telegram"** tab:
   - Select the operation (**Read** or **Write**).
   - Enter the **parameter number** (e.g., `700`, `2051`, `1082`).
   - Select the appropriate **AK (Request/Response Identifier)** from the dropdown.
   - Specify the **Subindex** if needed (default is `0`).
   - For write operations, enter the **parameter value** (e.g., `27`, `40.00`, `722.2`).
3. Click **"Calculate Telegram"** to generate the PKW telegram.

### 2. Decode Response Telegrams

1. Go to the **"Decode Response"** tab.
2. Enter the received telegram values:
   - **PKE (1st word)**
   - **IND (2nd word)**
   - **PWE1 (3rd word)**
   - **PWE2 (4th word)**
3. Click **"Decode Telegram"** to interpret the response, including **error codes** and **parameter values**.

## Examples

### Example 1: Writing 27 to Parameter 2051

For **Parameter 2051** with a value of **27** (Word):

```
1st word (PKE): 0x3033
2nd word (IND): 0080
3rd word (PWE1): 0x0000
4th word (PWE2): 0x001B
```

### Example 2: Reading Max Frequency from Parameter 1082

For **Parameter 1082** (Max Frequency, IEEE 754 Floating Point):

```
1st word (PKE): 0x143A
2nd word (IND): 0000
3rd word (PWE1): 0x0000
4th word (PWE2): 0x0000
```

Response:
```
1st word (PKE): 0x243A
2nd word (IND): 0000
3rd word (PWE1): 0x4248
4th word (PWE2): 0x0000
```

**Interpreted Value:** `50.00 Hz`

### Example 3: Error Response Interpretation

If a write request is sent to a parameter that cannot be modified while the drive is running, the response might be:

```
1st word (PKE): 0x743A
2nd word (IND): 0000
3rd word (PWE1): 0x0000
4th word (PWE2): 0x0011
```

**Error Code Interpretation:**  
`0x0011` corresponds to **"Request cannot be processed due to operating state"**, meaning the drive is in a state that prevents parameter modification.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter (for GUI development)**
- **struct module (for IEEE 754 conversions)**

## Future Work & Enhancements

- **Direct PLC Communication:**  
  Integrating libraries like **python-snap7** to directly communicate with **Siemens PLCs** for live parameter reading and writing.

- **Extended Error Handling:**  
  Expanding error interpretation to include **custom drive-specific fault codes**.

- **Integration with HMI Development:**  
  Potential to embed this tool into **HMI faceplates** for real-time parameter monitoring and adjustment.
